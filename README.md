# Object Tracking with OpenCV & Python
You should know there is a difference between object tracking and object detection.
#### Object tracking 
does frame-by-frame tracking but keeps the history of where the object is at a time after time
#### Object detection 
is the detection on every single frame and frame after frame.

## What are some of the applications that could be used?
Counting how many people are in a given location, verifying how many objects pass on a conveyor belt, or counting the vehicles on a highway are all examples of conceivable applications.
After watching the video, you will undoubtedly come up with thousands of ideas that can be used to real-life situations or perhaps to industry. This is unquestionably the tool to use if you need to construct a tri-section of things.

## What do we need?
1 The video of the highway we will use to count the vehicles
2 Tracker file
3 Main file
